# Android app that uses Google Firebase for managing app's users and their credentials. It also shows how to use WebView.

The majority of this code is based on what I learned from:

Android + Firebase Username/Password Authentication
https://www.udemy.com/course/android-firebase-usernamepassword-authentication/

This course was a great match for me. The instructor knows pretty well the subject, and knows how 
to explain it. The course is great not only to teach us about Google Firebase authentication with 
email, but also to refresh/learn some concepts regarding Android app development, e.g. the 
instructor guides us during all user interface development, explaining well how things are done. 
I highly recommend this course if you need to learn Google Firebase and/or refresh/learn concepts 
of Android app development.

To make this app work, make sure you have the file /app/google-services.json. You can get this file
if you create an account at Google Firebase, and then link this Android app to an App inside the 
Google Firebase. Once this is done, you will be able to download google-services.json and add it
to the /app folder.
